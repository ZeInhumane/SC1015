**Objective:**  
Investigate factors that influence graduate employment status and salary outcomes.  
We use the Graduate Employment Dataset to predict:

- **Salary** (regression, if available)

**Team Split:**  
- **Person A:** Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis  
- **Person B:** Machine Learning Modeling & Evaluation

This notebook documents the full end-to-end process.
