# Graduate Employment Analysis

**Objective:**  
Investigate if employer rating and salary outcomes are affected by choice of university and field of study.  
We use the Graduate Employment Dataset found at 
https://data.gov.sg/datasets?topics=education&page=1&resultId=d_3c55210de27fcccda2ed0c63fdd2b352.
This dataset contains results from a Ministry of Education(MOE) conducted survey, from January 2013 to December 2022.
It describes the annual statistics of employer ratings and income for each course of study from each university.

- **Employment Status** (binary classification)
- **Salary** (regression, if available)

**Team Split:**
